Google Rank Predictor/
- I built a web scrapper that grabs the first several results of a google search and gets various details about those
websites, such as how many H1 tags there are or how many keywords the page has that relate to the search query.
- I then used a machine learning classifier to predict the order in which sites would show up based on the search query.

Quizlet Search App/
- This application is meant to be part of a django project.
- The user would enter a question, then the application would search that question on google, tell google to only show

resembles the user question, then it would grab the answer and present it to the user.
